Overview
The highly anticipated sequel to the instant New York Times bestseller, A Good Girl&#039;s Guide to Murder!Â More dark secrets are exposed in this addictive, true-crime fueled mystery.Â 

 Pip is not a detective anymore.

 With the help of Ravi Singh, she released a true-crime podcast about the murder case they solved together last year. The podcast has gone viral, yet Pip insists her investigating days are behind her.

 But she will have to break that promise when someone she knows goes missing. Jamie Reynolds has disappeared, on the very same night the town hosted a memorial for the sixth-year anniversary of the deaths of Andie Bell and Sal Singh.

 The police won&#039;t do anything about it. And if they won&#039;t look for Jamie then Pip will, uncovering more of her town&#039;s dark secrets along the way... and this time everyone is listening. But will she find him before it&#039;s too late?
