A wandering fortune teller finds an unexpected family in this warm and wonderful debut fantasy, perfect for readers of Travis Baldree and Sangu Mandanna.
 
 Tao is an immigrant fortune teller, traveling between villages with just her trusty mule for company. She only tells &amp;quot;small&amp;quot; fortunes: whether it will hail next week; which boy the barmaid will kiss; when the cow will calve. She knows from bitter experience that big fortunes come with big consequencesâ€¦
 
 Even if itâ€™s a lonely life, itâ€™s better than the one she left behind. But a small fortune unexpectedly becomes something more when a (semi) reformed thief and an ex-mercenary recruit her into their desperate search for a lost child. Soon, theyâ€™re joined by a baker with a &amp;quot;knead&amp;quot; for adventure, andâ€”of courseâ€”a slightly magical cat.
 
 Tao starts down a new path with companions as big-hearted as her fortunes are small. But as she lowers her walls, the shadows of her past close inâ€”and sheâ€™ll have to decide whether to risk everything to preserve the family she never thought she could have.
