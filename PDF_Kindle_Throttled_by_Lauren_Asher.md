Overview
Notes From Your Bookseller A vlogger heroine, sibling rivalry and high heat make this sports romance a sizzling story that pulls out all the stops to hook you. New York Times bestseller and TikTok sensation Lauren Asher brings her signature heart, angst, and steam to a high-octane series of interconnected standalones featuring F1 drivers. Noah Slade is a legend in the making, and Maya Alatorre&#039;s brother&#039;s rival...but their forbidden passion is one move away from detonating. Noah Maya Alatorre is the sister of my teammateâ€¦and my new obsession. Keeping my distance during the Formula 1 season should be easy, except I always find ways to see her. Press tours. Pre-race rituals. Sponsor events and black-tie galas. The more time we spend together, the stronger my desire grows. Sneaking around with her is one thing, but wanting more? Never going to happen. She might be a distraction dressed like a daydream, but no woman is worth risking the championship title over. Or so I thought. Maya Noah Slade is Formula 1 royalty and my brother&#039;s biggest rival. When I&#039;m invited to join my sibling while he competes for the World Championship, I promise to avoid Noah at all costs. Twenty-one races. Two drivers who hate each other. And one forbidden attraction I can&#039;t ignore. Developing feelings for Noah wasn&#039;t part of my plan. But then again, neither was anyone finding out. Turns out the man I was warned about happens to be the one I can&#039;t stay away from. Even if he breaks my heart once the season comes to an end.
