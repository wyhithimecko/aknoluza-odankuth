Overview
Notes From Your Bookseller Zadie Smith is back with her first novel since 2016. A work of historical fiction, Smith takes on the divisive &quot;Tichborne Trial&quot; that took place in Victorian England ‚Äî and just happens to feature Charles Dickens. A brilliant book about authenticity and belief, this novel was well worth the wait. From acclaimed and bestselling novelist Zadie Smith, a kaleidoscopic work of historical fiction set against the legal trial that divided Victorian England, about who gets to tell their story‚Äîand who gets to be believed

 It is 1873. Mrs. Eliza Touchet is the Scottish housekeeper‚Äîand cousin by marriage‚Äîof a once-famous novelist, now in decline, William Ainsworth, with whom she has lived for thirty years.

 Mrs. Touchet is a woman of many interests: literature, justice, abolitionism, class, her cousin, his wives, this life and the next. But she is also sceptical. She suspects her cousin of having no talent; his successful friend, Mr. Charles Dickens, of being a bully and a moralist; and England of being a land of facades, in which nothing is quite what it seems.

 Andrew Bogle, meanwhile, grew up enslaved on the Hope Plantation, Jamaica. He knows every lump of sugar comes at a human cost. That the rich deceive the poor. And that people are more easily manipulated than they realize. When Bogle finds himself in London, star witness in a celebrated case of imposture, he knows his future depends on telling the right story.

 The ‚ÄúTichborne Trial‚Äù‚Äîwherein a lower-class butcher from Australia claimed he was in fact the rightful heir of a sizable estate and title‚Äîcaptivates Mrs. Touchet and all of England. Is Sir Roger Tichborne really who he says he is? Or is he a fraud? Mrs. Touchet is a woman of the world. Mr. Bogle is no fool. But in a world of hypocrisy and self-deception, deciding what is real proves a complicated task. . . .

 Based on real historical events, The Fraud is a dazzling novel about truth and fiction, Jamaica and Britain, fraudulence and authenticity and the mystery of ‚Äúother people.‚Äù
