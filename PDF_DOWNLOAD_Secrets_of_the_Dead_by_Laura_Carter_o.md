Overview
A princess dealing with the trauma of her past. An assassin who rules the Kingdom underworld. A disgraced woman, banished by her family. The grandson of a usurper. When an explosion kills all the royal families in the Kingdom of Novisia, four unlikely heirs are forced to take their parents&#039; place. NaÃ¯ve and inexperienced, the rulers must not only learn to lead their realms but grapple with their newly heightened powers. To uncover the mystery of their families&#039; deaths, the four must come together to uncover the truth. But as secrets are revealed and a prophecy predicts one of them will destroy the Kingdom, no one can be trusted - not even the dead. Perfect for fans of Sarah J Maas, Carissa Broadbent and Jennifer L. Armentrout
