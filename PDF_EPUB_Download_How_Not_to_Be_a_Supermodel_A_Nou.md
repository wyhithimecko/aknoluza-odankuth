Join Ruth Crilly in this comic memoir as she teeters through the noughties and lifts the lid on her days as an international fashion model. Told with unparalleled wit and remarkable detail, this is a book for anyone who dreams big and aims high but never quite reaches their goal. At twenty years old, five feet eight and with boobs that were &amp;#039;inconveniently fulsome&amp;#039;, Ruth was not quite young enough, tall enough or waif-like enough to ever hope for a meteoric rise to supermodel status. And yet her sheer optimism and questionable grasp on reality led her to abandon her law degree and begin a career with one of the biggest agencies in the world. Follow Ruth through a rip-roaring, hilarious decade of not-quite-making-it as a supermodel. Fuelled by little more than cigarettes and the stress of her spiralling debt she criss-crosses the world in pursuit of fame and fortune. But how far is she willing to go for this wildly unrealistic dream? Bridget Jones meets The Devil Wears Prada, How Not to Be a Supermodel is a time capsule of a book that dives into one of the world&amp;#039;s most fascinating industries. Offering a glimpse into both the high glamour and juddering reality of a by-gone era, this comic memoir tackles the darkest of subjects with the very lightest touch and injects humour and a heart-warming honesty into a story that could have so easily ended a different way.
