Overview
A celebration of Mexican ingredients and traditionsâ€”plus 100 favorite recipesâ€”from Eva Longoria

 While hosting Searching for Mexico on CNN, Eva Longoria reconnected with her Mexican roots and tasted iconic Mexican dishes like meat-stuffed Chiles en Nogada draped in a creamy walnut sauce and the YucatÃ¡n classic Pollo Asado, made with an aromatic garlic-citrus-achiote paste. In My Mexican Kitchen, she embraces the techniques and flavors she discovered and brings them home to her Southern California kitchen. From dishes based on long-heeded Aztec traditions like Chicken Enchiladas with Salsa Verde to her Tia Elsaâ€™s Pork and Red Chile Tamales and Conchas that remind her of Mexico City, each recipe offers a delicious tribute to Mexican food and flavors.Â 
 Â 
 In addition to recipes for Enfrijoladas, White Pozole, Shrimp Aguachile, Cheesy Tacos de Fideo with Chorizo, and Butternut Squash with Coconut Oil and Cayenne, Eva dives into the backstory of many key Mexican ingredients from vanilla to agave. Alongside recipes that are masa-based like gorditas and sopes, she writes about the history of maiz and masa, nixtamlization, and the commercialization of corn, and she speaks to tequila production and traditions prior to showcasing not one but three recipes for margaritas.Â 
 Â 
 Evaâ€™s genuine love for cooking and culinary-related history along with her pride for her heritage shine on every page of this beautiful, meaningful, and delectable cookbook.
