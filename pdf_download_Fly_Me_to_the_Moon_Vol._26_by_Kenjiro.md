First comes marriage, then comes an earthbound love that is out of this world!
 
 From the day his parents named him, Nasa Yuzaki has felt connected to outer space...whether he likes it or not. His efforts to outperform the space program veer off course when an accident introduces him to Tsukasa, a mysterious girl with strange powers. Is she an alien, a moon goddess, or something else? Since she insists on marrying him, Nasa will have plenty of chances to find out!
 
 Asimo has thrown down the gauntlet: if he can score at the top of the nation in his college entrance exams, heâ€™ll ask out his crush, the irrepressible tease Himari. Unfortunately for him, Nasa has decided to take the exams too, despite not being in high school or planning to attend college. Tsukasa has to convince Nasa to back away from the whole situation, and not because Himari keeps coming on to her husband. Well, not just because of that.
