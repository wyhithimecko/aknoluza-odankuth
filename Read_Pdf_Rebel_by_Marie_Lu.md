Respect the Legend. Idolize the Prodigy. Celebrate the Champion. But never underestimate the Rebel. With unmatched suspense and her signature cinematic storytelling, #1 New York Times‚Äìbestselling author Marie Lu plunges readers back into the unforgettable world of Legend for a truly grand finale. Eden Wing has been living in his brother‚Äôs shadow for years. Even though he‚Äôs a top student at his academy in Ross City, Antarctica, and a brilliant inventor, most people know him only as Daniel Wing‚Äôs little brother. A decade ago, Daniel was known as Day, the boy from the streets who led a revolution that saved the Republic of America. But Day is no longer the same young man who was once a national hero. These days he‚Äôd rather hide out from the world and leave his past behind. All that matters to him now is keeping Eden safe‚Äîeven if that also means giving up June, the great love of Daniel‚Äôs life. As the two brothers struggle to accept who they‚Äôve each become since their time in the Republic, a new danger creeps into the distance that‚Äôs grown between them. Eden soon finds himself drawn so far into Ross City‚Äôs dark side, even his legendary brother can‚Äôt save him. At least not on his own . . .
